#Possible Solutions

**Encourage the use of an existing source code host.**

This would mean there'd be no new system to be built however will mean more generic and lacking Minecraft specific entities and features.

**Generate Index of current self hosted sites and download links.**

This would also mean no new system would have to be build however the index could only be indexed by people. Also some sites require authentication or waiting for advertising which would break any automatic system.

**A User-Driven site that offers project hosting, search, screenshots of projects in action, issue reporting.**

This would build a centralised community, features specific to the needs of Minecraft developers and an open API can produce data in a useable format for developers and their 3rd Party apps.
