##Current System
The current system involves a distributed defunct ecosystem of websites hosting in a range of formats from version control systems to an array of ZIP files. There are some sites trying to build up an index of these, however itâ€™s by no means unknown for the original source to then either move the files or remove them hence breaking the indexes.

The following screenshots show some of the project sites and indexes.

Another landing page for a Plugin called 'WorldEdit'

Just for a scale of how many projects are already distributed across the internet, a simple Google search of "Minecraft Plugin" returns 6,270,000 Results.
